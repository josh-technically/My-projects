Hello all,
I’m still reading a ton of interesting information about server-side web frameworks and how the HTTP exchange happens. 
I wanted to get a solid grasp of the concepts, so I’m reading as much as possible. 
It takes longer, but it should be worth it. 
Tomorrow, I’ll read about the security side of things and get started with the Express.js tutorials. 
On another note, I need to read more about Deno. 
Sounds like that will come in handy down the road.
