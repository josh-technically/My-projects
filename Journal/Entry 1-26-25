Today, the main focus was on website security. 
The article I read was extensive but discussed the common threats to watch out for. 
The main topics were Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and a few honorable DoS and Clickjacking mentions. 
This subject was a bit difficult to understand in the first read. 
Luckily, other reading was recommended to me that I'll read later or as problems arise. 
For now, I'm focused on the project I'm trying to complete.
Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t get everything I wanted done today. 
I hoped to start the Express.js tutorials, but that will have to wait until after work tomorrow.
