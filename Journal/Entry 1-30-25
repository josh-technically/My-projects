Oh right! 
Learning Express.js and Nods.js is a steady process. 
I didnâ€™t realize how little I knew when starting this adventure. 
All is well; however, I learned a lot of exciting things about both of them. 
This weekend, I set up the development environment to finish the project I started working on, which was why I started to learn Express in the first place. 
Now, the fun begins!
